This repository contains a collection of Python exercises, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics like functions and classes.  
The exercises were sourced from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python) and serve as an excellent opportunity for me to practice and enhance my Python programming skills.  
I really recommend this site for everyone who want to practice any language programming!

## About

The exercises are organized in individual folders, each representing specific problem categories. The primary goal of this repository is to provide a central location for my practice, track my progress, and demonstrate my Python programming skills.  
Credit to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python) for the original exercises.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the exercises in this repository.  
Each exercise has a Readme file with explanations about what need to be done. Also, there are 2 files with the same name as the folder: One .py and the other _test.py: The first one is My solution for the exercise, and the other is used by PyTest in order to check and validate your answer.
- `Readme.md`: Is the Exercise Explanation 
- `folder_name.py`: Is My solution for the exercise
- `folder_name_test.py`: Is the file used by PyTest in order to check my solution
- `Help`: There are Links for configure the Pytest and submit theexercise for valitation in the Site
- `Hint`: Some exercises have a Hints file, which gives more information about the topic e resolution.
